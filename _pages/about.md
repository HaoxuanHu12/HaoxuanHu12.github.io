I am currently a first-year master's student at Sun Yat-sen University, School of Software Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Weibin Wu](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/249). I also work in the Zhuhai Key Laboratory of Trusted Large Language Models. Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree in School of Software Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University in 2024. 

My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI), including privacy leakage issues of LLMs and the robustness of LLMs. Specifically, I am interested in evaluating the safety of the LLMs, including harmful responses, copyrighted content, vulnerable codes, and so on.
