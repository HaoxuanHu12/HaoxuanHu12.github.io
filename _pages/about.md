I am currently a first-year master’s student at [School of Software Engineering](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/), Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by Prof. [Weibin Wu](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/249). I am also a member of the Zhuhai Key Laboratory of Trusted Large Language Models. Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University in 2024.

My research focuses on **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI)**, with particular interests in privacy leakage in large language models (LLMs) and the robustness of LLMs and vision-language models (VLLMs). Specifically, I aim to evaluate the safety of these models across multiple dimensions, including harmful responses, copyrighted content, vulnerable code generation, and more.

If you are interested in my research field, feel free to contact me by sending me e-mails 😀.
